# decred-research
A (wiki) repository for coordinating work on [Decred Open Source Research program](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb)

Each research project/idea (top level comment) will have its own page, for recording notes about discussions and developments, and other useful links. If you have something to add about a project/idea but don't see a page for it, you can add a new page for it.
